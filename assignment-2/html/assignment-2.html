      It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
      very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the
      Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very stormy existence,
      and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great
      fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At
      the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of
      three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being
      assisted by famine and disease.

      Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
      found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course
      I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently
      expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly
      woman in the usual peasant dress—white undergarment with long double

      modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, “The Herr Englishman?”
      “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She smiled, and gave some message to an
      elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He
      went, but immediately returned with a letter:—

      “My Friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting you.
      Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will start for
      Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage
      will await you and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from
      London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my
      beautiful land.
